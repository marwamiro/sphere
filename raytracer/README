BACKGROUND INFORMATION
======================

The ray tracing module was initially developed for the Sphere DEM
software: http://github.com/anders-dc/sphere

This is a port for visualizing simulation output from the 
ESys-Particle discrete element method software.

It is developed by Anders Damsgaard Christensen, adc@geo.au.dk, and
is licenced under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL).

Documentation can be found in the file doc/raytracer.pdf


REQUIREMENTS
============

For compiling the raytracer, the following software is required:
 - GNU compiler collection
 - CUDA developer drivers
 - CUDA toolkit
When executing the compiled code, a CUDA compatible GPU is
necessary, along with appropriate developer device drivers.


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
==================
 
The source code is built using GNU make with the command:
  ./make

A sample run can subsequently be started with:
  ./make run

Temporary files can be removed with:
  ./make clean
